# Mobile App Integration Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved âœ…
The mobile app was not connecting properly to the backend due to an incorrect API endpoint configuration.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Endpoint Correction
**File**: `C:\Users\papcy\Desktop\aethermobile\src\lib\config.ts`

**Problem**: The mobile app was trying to access `/api/agents/status` which doesn't exist.
**Solution**: Changed to `/api/agents` which is the correct endpoint.

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
agentStatus: '/api/agents/status'

// After (correct):
agentStatus: '/api/agents'
```

### 2. Services Started
All necessary Docker services were started:
- document-processor
- verification-service
- command-center-connector

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features
1. **Application Submission**: Mobile app can submit KYC applications
2. **Agent Processing**: Real-time agent status updates from Command Center
3. **Document Upload**: Documents can be uploaded for processing
4. **Status Tracking**: Application status can be checked in real-time
5. **CORS**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests

### ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Open Mobile App**: http://localhost:8083
2. **Complete Onboarding**:
   - Select account type
   - Fill personal information
   - Verify phone with OTP
   - Upload identity documents
   - Complete selfie verification
   - Add address details
   - Submit application

3. **Monitor Processing**: The submission holding screen will show real-time agent processing:
   - Sarah: Document OCR processing
   - Marcus: KYC verification
   - Elena: Account creation
   - David: Welcome notifications

## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| POST `/submit-application` | Submit new KYC application |
| POST `/upload-document/{id}/{type}` | Upload identity documents |
| GET `/application/{id}` | Check application status |
| GET `/api/agents` | Get agent processing status |
| GET `/health` | Service health check |

## Test Results

âœ… All systems operational:
- Backend API: Working
- Application Submission: Working
- Agent Processing: Working (5 agents active)
- Status Tracking: Working
- Mobile App: Running on port 8083

## Troubleshooting

If the mobile app doesn't work:

1. **Check all services are running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. **Verify backend health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8005/health
   ```

3. **Check Command Center agents**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8006/api/agents
   ```

4. **Test submission directly**:
   ```bash
   python verify-mobile-integration.py
   ```

The mobile app is now fully integrated and functional!
