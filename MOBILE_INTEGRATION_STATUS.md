### Mobile App
- **URL**: http://localhost:8083
- **Status**: âœ… Running
- **Backend Connection**: âœ… Connected to http://localhost:8005

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration

### Mobile App Environment (.env)
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8005
VITE_DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_URL=http://localhost:8001
VITE_VERIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8002
VITE_MESSAGE_ROUTER_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_COMMAND_CENTER_URL=http://localhost:8006
VITE_DASHBOARD_NOTIFIER_URL=http://localhost:8004
```

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Mobile App** submits application to User Forms API (port 8005)
2. **User Forms API** stores data and publishes to Kafka topics
3. **Topic Bridge** handles cross-system communication
4. **Document Processor** performs OCR on uploaded documents
5. **Verification Service** validates KYC information
6. **Command Center** monitors agent activity
7. **Dashboard Notifier** sends real-time updates

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Integration Page
Open the test page at: `file:///C:/Users/papcy/Desktop/unified-agents-platform/test-mobile-integration.html`

This page allows you to:
- Check all service health statuses
- Submit test applications
- Upload documents
- Check application status
- Run complete workflow tests

### API Endpoints
The mobile app connects to these endpoints:
- `POST /submit-application` - Submit new application
- `POST /upload-document/{id}/{type}` - Upload document
- `GET /application/{id}` - Get application status
- `GET /health` - Service health check

## âœ… Verification

Test submission was successful:
```json
{
    "application_id": "f78539b5-056b-4bf0-aa58-cc75cb997f90",
    "status": "submitted",
    "submission_timestamp": "2025-09-19T14:20:40.370356",
    "estimated_processing_time": "2-3 business days"
}
```

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Features Working

- âœ… User registration form
- âœ… Document type selection
- âœ… Personal information submission
- âœ… Document upload capability
- âœ… Real-time status checking
- âœ… Integration with backend services

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Open the mobile app at http://localhost:8083
